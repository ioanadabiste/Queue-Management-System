# Queue-Management-System
#  Queue Management System – Java  

A simulation-based **Queue Management System** built in **Java**, designed to model and optimize how clients are distributed across multiple queues using various strategies.  

---

## Features  

-  **Implements the Strategy Design Pattern** with multiple scheduling approaches (`ConcreteStrategyTime`, `ConcreteStrategyQueue`)  
-  **Simulates client arrivals, waiting times, and service processing**  
-  **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with Swing (`SimulationFrame`, `SimulationSetupFrame`)  
-  **Multithreading support** for real-time queue updates and concurrent task execution  
-  **Modular OOP structure** with classes like `Scheduler`, `QueueManagementSystem`, and `SimulationManager`  
-  **Customizable parameters** for arrival times, service times, and the number of queues

##  Purpose  

Created to explore **task scheduling, concurrency, and queue optimization** through an interactive Java simulation.  
This project demonstrates the application of **design patterns**, **multithreading**, and **GUI development** in Java.
